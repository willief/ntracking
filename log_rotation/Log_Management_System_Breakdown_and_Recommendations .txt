Log Management System Breakdown and Recommendations
====================================================

Log Generation
--------------
- Cron Job: Runs every X minutes to log resources and append the output to a log file named with the current date. (20min) by default.
- Command: `*/20 * * * * /bin/bash $HOME/resources.sh >> $HOME/resources_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).log 2>&1`
- Script: `resources.sh`

`log_rm.sh`
------------
- Script: Removes logs older than X days. (3) by default.
- Cron Job: Runs daily at 5 minutes past midnight.
- Command: `5 0 * * * /bin/bash $HOME/log_rm.sh`

`sync_logs.sh`
-------------------
- Script: Uses rsync to synchronize logs from remote machines to a central machine.
- execute_steps.sh: runs this script before log generation.

`merge_logs.sh`
-----------------------------
- Script: Merges logs from the last X days into a single file for each machine (e.g., resources1.log).
- execute_steps.sh: runs this script before log generation.


Plotly Graph Generation
------------------------
- `execute_steps.sh` runs the graphing process at 2 minutes past every hour. 
- Command: `2 * * * * /bin/bash /home/wyse/ntracking/execute_steps.sh >> /home/wyse/ntracking/cron.log 2>&1`
